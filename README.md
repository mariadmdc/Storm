**[Visit our website](https://mariadmdc.github.io/Storm/)** to learn more about Storm!

## Introduction

Storm is a high-level, object oriented programming language brought to you by Jack Seymour, Lydia Worku, Gavin Butts, Jacquelyn Young-Bowers, and Maria Dominguez. This language was created for young children who are learning how to code. This easy-to-learn language is also helpful for any beginning programmers, as it contains consistent and readable code.

## Features

Storm is statically types, requiring the users to declare any variables, functions, or classes. To declare a new instance of _anything_, simply state `set...` (similar to `var` in other languages). We require the user to state the ending of loops, functions, or classes. In addition, instead of a "for loop", we refer to them as "laps". Lastly, to avoid the complexity of input streams in low high-level langaues, simply use "ask" to substitute.

## Examples of Programs

Five example programs can be found the the examples folder, including:

> `ask-example.storm` > `lap-example.storm` > `program-example.storm` > `recursion-example.storm` > `object-example.storm`

For instance, `program-example.storm` looks like:

```
 # program (function) example - pizza counter
set program countSlices(people)
    set slicesEach to 2
    set totalSlicesNeeded to people * slicesEach
    say "You need " + totalSlicesNeeded + " slices of pizza for " + people + " people!"
end program

countSlices(10)   # Call the function for 10 people
countSlices(20)   # Call the function for 20 people
```

Similarly, an example of our laps functionality is seen below:

```
# infinite lap (loop) example
set laps to 0
start lap forever
    set laps to laps + 1
    say "You are on lap " + laps
    if laps = 4
        say "You finished 4 laps! You completed the mile!"
        stop running
    end if
lap
```
